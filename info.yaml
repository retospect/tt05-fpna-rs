  top_module:  "tt_um_retospect_neurochip"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  how_it_works: |
      An array of neuromorphic CNBs (Configurable Neuron Blocks). Each CNB has a 
      3 inputs, and 3 associated weights, that get added to its membrane potential. 
      When a CNB fires, it sends a pulse to 3 of its neighbours.
      Each CNB is subscribed to one of 8 decay clock tools. 

      Each CNB can be initialized with weights, the selection of its :
      Uses a set of registers to divide the clock, and then some combinational logic
      to convert from binary to decimal for the display.

      An example on how to train a set of weights and other parameters for this tool is 
      https://github.com/retospect/naxon .



# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      After reset, clock in the bitstream to configure all the weights and stuff.
      Then clock in the test data from the generated test bench from naxon, and see the appropriate answer come out!
